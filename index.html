      <p class="text-xs text-neutral-950/30 mb-4">Esmee confessing herself that she likes Cassi</p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        In a quiet but closely-watched development among classmates, it has come to light that
        <strong>Esmee Nurmi</strong>, 14, has a noticeable crush on her friend <strong>Cassi K</strong>.
        The situation is made more complex by the fact that Esmee is openly lesbian, while Cassi has
        identified as straight.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        According to students who know both girls, Esmee’s feelings are genuine and respectful. While
        she has not made any direct move, her friends say it’s “pretty clear” how she feels. Cassi,
        meanwhile, is known to be very close with Esmee and sometimes behaves in ways that might come
        off as flirtatious — though she has not expressed any romantic interest and continues to identify as straight.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        This has led to some confusion for Esmee and their peers. “It’s just hard when someone acts
        differently around you than they do with others,” one student said. “But that doesn’t mean
        there’s bad intent — they’re both still figuring things out, like everyone else our age.”
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Classmates agree that the friendship between Esmee and Cassi is strong, and there’s no sign of
        tension. “They’re really close — and they care about each other. That’s what matters most,” said another student.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        For now, it seems that both girls are navigating the situation with maturity and kindness — and
        their peers are watching with quiet support, hoping the friendship remains strong no matter what.
